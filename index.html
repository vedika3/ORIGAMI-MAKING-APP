     <h3>   (i) Cranes are a family, the Gruidae, of large, long-legged, and long-necked birds in the group Gruiformes. </h3>
     <h3>  (ii) The 15 species of cranes are placed in three genera, Antigone, Balearica, and Grus.  </h3>

     <h3>   (i) To express happiness, bunnies will sometimes jump around and flick their heads and feet. </h3>
     <h3>  (ii) A bunny’s big ears aren’t just for listening! They also help regulate the rabbit’s body temperatures. The ears’ blood vessels swell when it’s hot out, and contract when it’s cold and can rotate it 280 degree. </h3>
     <h3> (iii) To some, rabbits might seem like quiet pets, but they’re actually capable of making a lot of sounds, including growling, screeching, chattering their teeth, and even honking softly. </h3>
